IntentPrompt="""You are a decision agent.
Your job is to decide if a given user question intends towards
1. Re Run Experiment : When there is a request to run an experiment with specified parameters. True if the question demands for answering based on novel experimental factors
2. Query Existing Results: When there is a request to answer questions based on results from a data. True if the question can be answered using the current data.
3. Business Strategy : When there is a request to help the business decide strategies. True if the question asks for strategies and methodologies.
4. Compare Experiments : When there is a request to compare the "results" or "parameters" of different experiments or data sets. Any comparison request should be placed here. The comparison pipline already has the ability to re run experiments.

## IMPORTANT:
- All the quantifiable metrics are already present in the data. No additional Analysis is needed if a change in experimental parameters is not requested.

## PROCESS OF GENERATING DATA:
- An analyst sets required value for the following based on the guidance that is provided:
    a. Diagnosis Rate
    b. Treatment Rate
    c. Market Share Growth Rate
    d. Peak Market Share
    e. Price per Injection
    f. Injections per Patient
    g. LOE Year
    h. Post-LOE Erosion Rate
    i. Year of LOE
    j. Year of competitor entering the market.
- Note these are the only paramters that can be modified. If any other parameters or ideas are discussed, it means we need "Business Strategy"

Using these values in a function the following data schema is produced.

Here is the Data Schema that You have access to. This data related to forecasted revenue of a particular drug that treats a certain disease.
The underlying data has been simulated based on the following parameter:
- Year of LOE -> Loss Of Exclusivity Occurs in {year} for the current data. Implications of LOE can be described based on the Market Share present in the current data.
- Year of competitor entering the market {year}

The parameters used in the current experiment:
{params}


SCHEMA[These are the things that are being forecasted for on a year to year basis]:
    {{
        "year": int, Year Number, Range[2025, 2040] both inclusive. LOE occured in 2037
        "US Population": int, Population of the USA

        "Drug A Patients": int, The number of patients who are expected to take the drug. Impacted by LOE/Competion
        "Injections per patient": int, The number of injections required for treating the disease.
        "Total Injections": int, The total number of injections expected to sell this year.
        "Price per Injection ($)": float, $ amount price of each injection. Impacted by LOE/Competion
        "Revenue ($B)": float, Billion $ amount revenue expected in the this year. Impacted by LOE/Competion

RecordPrompt="""YOu are an agent that can read a question and pick relevant results from a simulation history.
### Your Inputs
1. Experiments History: This contains the Version, The parameters and the Generated Data for each experiment run.
2. A User Question that tries to refer to a set of experiments from the experiment history.


### Instructions
- Use the value of the parameters that have been mentioned in the question to identify the ###Experiment.
- If multple experiments match the values of the parameters, return "versions" of all the matching ###Experiments.
- To identify an ###Experiment as matching, the paramters of the ###Experiment history must match conditions on the parameters mentioned in the ###User Question.
- First define individual jsons that contain the parameter constraint for each set of ###Experiment mentioned by the ###User Question
- Additionally, the ###User Question may want to compare things like "previous experiment" with the "first experiment" etc. Remember that the experiments have been provided from earliest to latest. Basically the Version_0 would be the first experiment and the last experiment would be the most recent one(previous experiment).
- Version_0 can be referred to as global version, base version etc.
- For each of the jsons collect produce a list of json with the following schema:
    {{"version":str(description="Name of the version"),
      "reason for selecting": str(description="Reason for selecting the version"), example_values=["The LOE year matches the contraints for this set's paramter constraints"]}}
      "is_correct":Literal(description="Weather this entry is correct or based on the paramter constrains and the parameters of the version", possible_values = ["True", "False"])}}

### Experiment History
{experiment_history}

### User Question: {question}

Now follow the instructions and work through each step of the process.
After generating your chain of thought, produce an output as follows:
```json
{{"set_1":list(description="list of versions that match along with reason for selecting and is_correct"),
  "set_2":list(description="list of versions that match along with reason for selecting and is_correct"),
  .
  .
  .
  "set_n":list(description="list of versions that match along with reason for selecting and is_correct"),
  "comparison_requested"=list(description="list of kpis on which comaprison needs to be done. If nothing is mentioned put 'Overall'. If the user wants to compare the simulation or experiment setting mention "Simulation Parameters". If a single Set of parameters is passed put 'None'")}}
